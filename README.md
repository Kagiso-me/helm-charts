# 🧰 Self-Hosted Helm Chart Repo (via GitHub Pages)

Hey there 👋

This is my **personal Helm chart repository**, self-hosted using **GitHub Pages** as part of my ongoing journey into Kubernetes, self-hosting, and building out my homelab.

The goal? Host my own charts, avoid third-party dependencies, and learn more by doing it all myself.

## 📁 What's in Here

- `.tgz` Helm chart packages
- `index.yaml` generated by `helm repo index`
- GitHub Pages serves everything from the `gh-pages` branch

## 🌐 GitHub Pages Setup

I'm using GitHub Pages to host this:

- The `gh-pages` branch is configured as the publish source
- Static files (`index.yaml` and `.tgz` packages) live there and are served directly by GitHub

No server setup required — just push and go.

## 🛠️ Why I'm Doing This

This repo is part of my bigger homelab goals:

- Learning Kubernetes beyond just deploying apps
- Managing my own Helm charts with version control
- Reducing reliance on external services
- Building tools I actually understand

## 🔄 To-Do / Future Plans

- [ ] GitHub Actions to auto-package and index charts on commit
- [ ] Improve chart linting and versioning
- [ ] Possibly split stable/experimental charts later
